# Rubik's Cube Solver using Korf's IDA* Algorithm

## 📌 Objective
Developed a fast Rubik’s Cube solver in **C++** using advanced algorithms and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧩 **Modeled a virtual 3×3 Rubik’s Cube** in three classes, leveraging C++ data structures like `unordered_map` for efficient design.
- 🏗️ **Applied OOP concepts** such as virtual functions, inheritance, and operator overloading for maximum flexibility and **code reusability**.
- ⚡ **Optimized BFS, DFS, and IDDFS algorithms** to consistently achieve **sub-3-second solving time** for an 8-scramble Rubik’s Cube.
- 🔍 **Implemented Korf’s IDA\*** algorithm, solving a **13-scramble Rubik’s Cube in under 10 seconds** through advanced heuristic search.
